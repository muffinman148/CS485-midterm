## Own Contributions
* All art is created by me through Adobe Illustrator
* Jumping "once" by using grounding through Rayscan

## Future Improvements
* Level system with alternate layouts
* Add Power Ups:
    * Kind of like mario where he gets stronger
* Add negatively impacting blocks:
    * blocks that limit jumping
    * blocks that force player to bounce
* Highscoring system
